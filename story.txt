OROBOROS.
The manifestation of the seemingly endless cycle of life and death. Of the sentient, and the desolate.
To maintain this cycle, a great sacrifice is needed -- the eternal serpent must consume itself again and again for every initiated iteration.

TUTORIAL
The creature's incomprehensible nature allows it to phase in and out of planes of existence via the means of GATES.
It can willingly choose to go into a gate, but it's not always necessary.
