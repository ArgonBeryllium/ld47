 == IDEA DEVELOPMENT ==
 
 =OROBOROS=
- mood: ancient and ominous undercut by humour
- gameplay: physics-based linked snake
	- eat enough to be able to eat your own tail?
	- go through a maze(tile-based becomes an option)?
	- tail has a mind of its own?
		- keeps defending itself from you using things it finds laying around?
	- find your own tail in a sea of others?
	- tie yourself in a knot?
