And thus, the mystical serpent
managed to keep the eternal
cycle in motion.#The balance of reality
was kept intact.#The sun kept rising
and setting.#People kept dying,
children kept being born.#And all was well
in the world.#(y'know, ignoring the
genocides, natural disasters,
poverty, corrupt governments,
pandemics, pineapple pizza...)
