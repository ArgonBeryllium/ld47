OROBOROS.#All is one.
The world serpent.
Eternity.#The soul of the world.
Ra-Orasis.#The manifestation
of the seemingly
endless cycle
of life and death.#Of the sentient,
and the desolate.#To maintain this cycle,
a great sacrifice
is needed;#the eternal serpent
must consume itself
again and again#for every new iteration.#The realm of its dwelling,
however, is one filled with
cramped tunnels and rifts
in spacetime itself.#Navigating such a space
truly is a challenge worthy
of this otherwordly being.#Pretty pretentious lore
for a snake clone, eh?
